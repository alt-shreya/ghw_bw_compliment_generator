> _“Imagine if trees gave off Wifi signals. We would be planting so many trees and we'd probably save the planet too. <br> Too bad they only produce the oxygen we breathe.”_

Your plant literally contributes to keeping you alive, and what do you do for it in return? Forget to water it and neglect it? 

That stops now. With the compliment generator for your plant, you cna pay your plant a compliment, and also hopefully remember to water it. This is the kind of mutual [symbiosis that old Al' was talking about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis#:~:text=In%201877%2C%20Albert%20Bernhard%20Frank,living%20together%20of%20unlike%20organisms%22.)
